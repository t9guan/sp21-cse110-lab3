                            <p>Throughout today I did my work and attempted to work on my resume, since I haven't touched that thing in a while. One of my friends started a GoFundMe for her nonprofit organization. She explained that it is to raise money to put pepper sprays in the hands of our elderlies in SF and Oakland Chinatown. Since my parents owns a store with many asian employees, I instantly donated to the <a href="https://gofund.me/f127055d">Equip Our Elderly Project</a>. I also sent this link to friends and family to further spread the word as the rise in Asian hate crimes are increasing at an alarming speed.</p>

                            <p>Since today is a Saturday, I went out to Oakland to help my parents at the store. Not much happened other than the constant reshelving and inventory checking throughout the day. I should really get to making that inventory system that I said I was gonna make. I even bought the barcode scanner for it. After the work day, I went home to do more school work and have a few chats with my friends on discord.</p>

                            <p>Today was a rare day off where I didn't need to goto Oakland to help out, so I spent the day relaxing and taking care of my kitchen tools. I reseasoned my cast iron skillets, and sharpened most of my knives. After that I played a few games with my friends to catch up and to have some fun. This was a definite need of a reset day for me before going back into the hectic world as it is today.</p>
